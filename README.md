We made this in an intra-college hackathon.

# problem statement
Farmers all around the world have vast acreages and confront the challenge of crop monitoring on a regular basis. To design an algorithm that would assist them in monitoring their crops and in informing farmers about crop health.
According to health, it will classify diseases. To assist with this, you must construct a machine learning model that classifies disease.
To assist you, we have provided dataset with four classifications; now it's up to you to design an ML model.

# solution
We have made a deep learning model by implementing Convolutional Neural Network by help of Tensorflow.
